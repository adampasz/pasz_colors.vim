# Stonewashed Themes
## Overview
This repo. features a (growing) collection of simple themes designed to make your development experience more comfortable (like your favorite pair of jeans). 

### Tips

* I have tested on Mac, Ubuntu and Windows (in [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/)).

* If you are using the light them, I recommend setting your terminal background color to `#EEEEEE` for best results.

* I also recommend enabling italics in your terminal, which I use to highlight comments, strings and other special sections of text.

## Stonewashed Vim
A simple but stylish vim theme, with suggestions for developing your own.

### Usage
Copy everything in `colors/` into `~/.vim/colors/`. You can also use [symlinks](https://github.com/adampasz/stonewashed-themes/blob/master/symlinks.sh).

For the light theme, add the following lines to your .vimrc (or use code from the sample vimrc.vim provided).

```
" load my color scheme
if has("gui_running")
  colorscheme stonewashed-gui
else
  colorscheme stonewashed-256
endif

" turn on syntax highlighting
syntax on

```
For the dark theme, use `stonewashed-dark-gui` and `stonewashed-dark-256` instead.

### Goals

#### A "Washed-Out" Style
I prefer light themes, but most of the ones I tried felt too garrish and bright.  I wanted something more muted. I avoid primary colors, except when trying to call attention to some text (Errors, TODOs, etc.).

#### Easy to Modify
Many of the themes I evaluated had 100's of lines, and included language-specific syntax. The colorscheme can be used starting point for your own customizations. That said, I've tried to make it look nice out-of-the-box in most standard languages.

#### Support gui and terminal Modes
The colorscheme works work in both gui (i.e. MacVim) and terminal Vim. At first I considered using a plugin like CSApprox to support both modes.  But, at the end, I decided I needed more direct control over the colors because there were subtle differences between the modes that were difficult to pin down.

#### Learn More About Vim
Investing hours to derive the perfect color scheme is a bit of a fools errand.  The ultimate goal of this project was to understand Vim a little better. I have tried to organize the code in such a way that it is easy for others to jump in and learn by playing with it.

## Stonewash My ZSH
Add stonewashed prompts to the [Oh My ZSH](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) shell. I find the Git and SVN version info (on the right side) to be invaluable.
![Oh My Zsh](gallery/zsh.png?raw=true "zsh")

### Usage
Copy `themes/stonewashed.zsh-theme` to ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/
In your .zshrc, add the following line

```
ZSH_THEME="stonewashed"
```

For git and/or svn coloring, make sure to include the svn-fast-info and git-prompt plugins (in addition to any plugins you're already using), e.g.: 

```
plugins=(svn-fast-info git-prompt)
```
## Stonewash Tmux
Stonewashed 256-color status bar and tabs for Tmux.

### Usage
Source tmux-stonewashed-256.conf from your ~/.tmux.conf. e.g.:
```
source-file path/to/stonewashed/themes/repo/tmux-stonewashed-256.conf
```
